# AddressTransferDestination

The information about the transaction destination type `Address`. Refer to [Transaction sources and destinations](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/transactions/sources-and-destinations) for a detailed introduction about the supported sources and destinations for each transaction type.  **You need to specify either the `account_output` property or the `utxo_outputs` property.**  You can transfer tokens to multiple addresses only if you use MPC Wallets as the transaction source. To do this, you should use the `utxo_outputs` property to specify the destination addresses.  Switch between the tabs to display the properties for different transaction destinations.
