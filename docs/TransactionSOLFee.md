# TransactionSOLFee

The transaction fee actually charged by the chain that uses the Solana fee model.  In this model, the fee is calculated as: fee = base fee + (compute unit price * compute unit limit) + rent (if applicable). For more details, refer to [Fee models](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/transactions/estimate-fees#fee-models).  Switch between the tabs to display the properties for different transaction fee models. 

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**baseFee** | **String** | A fixed fee charged per signature. The default is 5,000 lamports per signature. |  [optional] |
|**rentAmount** | **String** | The rent fee charged by the network to store nonâ€“rent-exempt accounts on-chain. It is deducted periodically until the account maintains the minimum balance required for rent exemption. |  [optional] |
|**computeUnitPrice** | **String** | The price paid per compute unit. This value determines the priority fee for the transaction, allowing you to increase inclusion probability in congested conditions. |  [optional] |
|**computeUnitLimit** | **String** | The maximum number of compute units your transaction is allowed to consume. It sets an upper bound on computational resource usage to prevent overload. |  [optional] |
|**feeType** | **FeeType** |  |  |
|**tokenId** | **String** | The token used to pay the transaction fee. |  [optional] |
|**feeUsed** | **String** | The actually charged transaction fee. |  [optional] |
|**estimatedFeeUsed** | **String** | The estimated transaction fee. |  [optional] |
