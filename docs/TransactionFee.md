|**maxPriorityFeePerGas** | **String** | The maximum priority fee per gas unit used, in wei. The maximum priority fee represents the highest amount of miner tips that you are willing to pay for your transaction. |  [optional] |
|**gasLimit** | **String** | The maximum amount of gas your transaction is allowed to consume. |  [optional] |
|**gasPrice** | **String** | The gas price, in wei. The gas price represents the amount of ETH that must be paid to validators for processing transactions per gas unit used. |  [optional] |
