## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**gasPremium** | **String** | An optional tip you can include to prioritize your transaction. The gas premium incentivizes miners to include your transaction sooner than those offering only the base fee. |  |
|**gasFeeCap** | **String** | The maximum gas price you are willing to pay per unit of gas. |  |
|**gasLimit** | **String** | The maximum amount of gas your transaction is allowed to consume. |  |
|**gasBase** | **String** | The minimum fee required for a transaction to be included in a block. The base fee is dynamically adjusted based on network congestion to maintain target block utilization. It is burned rather than paid to miners, reducing the total Filecoin supply over time. |  |
