# EstimatedUtxoFeeSlow


## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**feeRate** | **String** | The fee rate in sat/vByte. The fee rate represents the satoshis you are willing to pay for each byte of data that your transaction will consume on the blockchain. |  |
|**fallback** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether the estimated fee is generated from Cobo’s fallback mechanism. When the estimated transaction belongs to a UTXO-based chain and the specified address does not have sufficient balance to cover the on-chain fee, this field will be set to &#x60;true&#x60;. In this case, the returned fee value is estimated by Cobo’s internal fallback strategy, which is typically higher than the actual on-chain fee. When &#x60;fallback&#x60; is &#x60;true&#x60;, please use the estimated fee value with caution. |  [optional] |
|**feeAmount** | **String** | The transaction fee that you need to pay for the transaction. |  |
